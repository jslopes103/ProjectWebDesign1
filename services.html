                        <h2>Property Management Services</h2>
                        <p> More and more people in Ireland are living in apartments and multi-unit developments. SL Property Management is your partner to excellent 
                        management. We will ensure your development is a great place to live and maximise your return on your investment.When it comes to operations, 
                        real estate will always need a local presence. But with a SL Property manager, you don’t have to be an expert on home ownership or the area 
                        where your investment is located. Not only will your property manager have strong expertise of current laws, regulations and ordinances, they’ll 
                        also know how to correctly address them. This will help avoid issues from the get go, and having to deal with them down the road. For many landlords, 
                        maintenance requests are often the biggest pain point. The promise of passive income no longer seems so alluring when you’re trying to get a raccoon 
                        out of a tenant’s chimney in a safe and humane way at 3 a.m. </p>
                        
                        <h2>Services can be provided for Offices, Financial, General Management</h2>
                        <p>Commercial Property Management is the administration, operation and oversight of a defined property, as used in its broadest terms, on behalf of a party 
                        holding a legal interest in that property whether as landlord, tenant or otherwise. The objective is to manage that property in line with the principles of
                        best practices and the business interests of that party. A commercial Property Manager may act for different types of client who will typically have a legal
                        interest in the asset. It is common for some Property Managers to act in regard to a group of assets or a portfolio. Real estate property management involves 
                        an understanding of operating expenses and budgeting. From this information, appropriate rental rates are set, balanced by the current market and what it will 
                        support in the way of rents. A firm knowledge of the area and competitive rental properties is required. Those considering specialization in real estate property
                        management needs to understand the requirements and have a good feeling about being able to accomplish them all with efficiency and enjoyment. It's not as easy as
                        selling real estate.</p>
