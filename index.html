                        <h4>Rising rent in Dublin</h4>
                        <p align="justify">Note that rental prices are expected to increase more than 17 per cent over in Dublin the next three years.
                        Dr John McCartney, director of research for Savills, said rising house prices and tight mortgage lending had created a 
                        shift from owner-occupation to private renting. The report also references the rising number of residential investment transactions 
                         happening before the units are built, with most entering forward-purchase arrangements with developers to buy rental blocks once they are completed.</p>

                        masterplan minimising errors and confusion in the build. As this can happen when there is multiple staff or various companies on one site. i.e 
                        ground crews, bricklayers, steel & glazing erectors, roofers, electricians, landscapers, painters & decorators, Kitchen and bathroom providers etc.
                        Legal aspect, when selling for example. It enables the client to visualize their dream build prior to a block being laid.</p>
