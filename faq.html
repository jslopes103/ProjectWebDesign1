                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <!-- Questions asked on property management sites -->
                <ul>
                <p><b>Q. What rent can I charge?</b></p>
                <p> A. You can charge a full market rent. It may be useful to look in the local paper in the property or 
                    classified section under accommodation for an idea of local market rents.</p>
                    
                 <p><b>Q. How do I create an assured short hold tenancy?</b></p>
                 <p>A. You need to agree the main terms of the letting with your tenant; the monthly or weekly rent, 
                    and the length of the term of letting. This should be done with a standard form called a tenancy agreement.</p>  
            
                 <p><b>Q. What happens when the fixed term of an assured tenancy comes to an end?</b></p>
                 <p>A. Your tenant has the right to remain in the property until the court has granted you possession. In the case 
                    of an assured short hold tenancy, the court must grant you possession if you apply for it once the fixed term is over. 
                    To bring an end to a full assured tenancy you will need to use one of the seventeen grounds.</p> 

                  <p><b>Q. What if the property is mortgaged?</b></p>
                  <p> A. Most mortgage deeds prevent you from letting without your lender's consent. Ask him before taking on a tenant.</p>

                  <p><b>Q. What if I am leaseholder?</b></p>
                  <p>A. You should check the terms of your lease, and if necessary ask your landlord's permission.</p> 

                  <p><b>Q. Who pays for what?</b></p>
                  <p>A. If you grant a tenancy for a period of less than seven years - and this includes those tenancies which are not 
                    granted for a fixed period but run from week to week or month to month, - then you are by law responsible for certain basic repairs, 
                    including those to: </p>
                  
                  <p><b>Q. Who is the management agent?</b></p>
                  <p> A. The management agent is a person or company employed by the Board of Directors to carry out day-to-day management functions of the management company.</p>
                  
                  <p><b>Q. Why does the management company require a managing agent?</b></p>
                  <p>A. As the Board of Directors acts in a voluntary capacity, it often makes practical sense to delegate day-to-day management functions to an agent. 
                    The agent should also have expertise in the area of statutory and regulatory requirements for the management company.</p>

                  <p><b> Q. What does the managing agent do?</b></p>
                  <p>A. The agentâ€™s duties include collection of service charge, repairs and maintenance, communication with members, financial management, including preparation of 
                    accounts for audit and insurance management.</p>
