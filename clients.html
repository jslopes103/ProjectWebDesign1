                have been promptly and professionally dealt with. We live in a lovely and well maintained home and feel that we are treated fairly and with respect. 
                Happy to recommend SL Property!"</p>

                <p align="justify">“Below you will read what I said in 2012. Since then I have had no reason to change my opinion. In fact in my latest chairman’s report to my members 
                I have said that RFPM have treated our development “as if it was their home”. The apartments sell very quickly at above market prices which is due to a 
                number of factors but significantly the care and attention provided by SL Property.”</p>

                Management Committee since 2009. As a resident and owner, it has been very important for me to live in a complex that is well managed, safe, well

                from start-2012. Since that time, we have noticed a huge increase in the level of professionalism in how the development is being managed.
                They have systematically worked through a series of issues relating to the building and have ensured that we are fully compliant with the MUD Act and 
                other relevant legislation. In 2014, we had complex issues in relation to planning matters and they were able to provide expert input when required."</p>

                <p align="justify">“Myself and my wife are retired and we bought an apartment in Wyckham Place when the development was built in 2008. It is very important to us that 
                the development is safe, secure and well managed. We are extremely happy with the proactive way in which SL Property manages the development.
                In relation to onsite issues, myself and the other owner-directors regularly e-mail RFPM in relation to relatively small onsite matters. 
                The SL Property manager for Wyckham Place deals with these issues promptly and brings in any expertise required."</p>
